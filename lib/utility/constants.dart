const String description = '''
Helene Parr, also known as Elastigirl or Mrs. Incredible, is a fictional character who appears in Pixar's animated superhero film The Incredibles (2004) and its sequel Incredibles 2 (2018).

Voiced by actress Holly Hunter, the character is a superhero who possesses superhuman elasticity, granting her the ability to stretch any part of her body to great proportions. Helen is introduced in the first film as an accomplished superheroine forced into retirement with her husband Bob (Mr. Incredible) after superheroes are outlawed.''';

const String powersAndAbilities = '''
Elastigirl's primary superpower is elasticity, which allows her to stretch various parts of her body to many different sizes. This ability can extend to shapeshifting, as she can use elasticity to change her form and density, as when she morphed into a boat and a parachute.
    
She can achieve superhuman levels of strength, durability, and agility using her elasticity powers. In addition to her powers, Elastigrl is a capable pilot, operative, and tactician, as well as an exceptional hand-to-hand combatant.''';
